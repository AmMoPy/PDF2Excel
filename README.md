### About
Being able to programmatically extract tables from PDF documents and save them in different formats is so handy especially if you are, for some reason, limited by such output.

This notebook contains a walkthrough of a whole conversion process (loading, editing and saving) using a messy table of popular financial ratios used by NGOs.

### Code
Python 3 using tabula and pandas libraries.

### Why this method
- Preserve confidentiality, no need to expose your data to a third party for conversion.
- Convenient if you are dealing with large dataset extracted in XPS/PDF format.
- Convert, edit and save all at once.
